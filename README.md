# Jvm-Procedural-Benchmarks
My tests for how far I can take Java primitives to write solutions that are *not* object-oriented.
No, these are not "benchmarks". They are not *fair,* benchmarks. The point is to show how these patterns *work* and how they are supposed to be *used*.

*Maybe start thinking in management systems that allocate arrays of primitives instead of boxed types now?*
